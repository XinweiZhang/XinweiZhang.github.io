Greetings,

Currently, I hold the position of Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Biostatistics Department at the [School of Global Public Health, New York University](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/). My research primarily revolves around statistical learning, with a particular emphasis on multi-class classification and support-vector machines. Additionally, I possess specialized expertise in generative models, notably energy-based and diffusion models.


I was conferred a Ph.D. in Statistics from Rutgers University, where I had the privilege of conducting my research under the guidance of Professor [Zhiqiang Tan](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/ztan/index.html). Preceding this accomplishment, I was awarded an A.M. in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis. Furthermore, my academic foundation includes a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in tandem with a B.E. in Computer Science, both from Renmin University of China.

Through this platform, I aim to share my research and projects with a wider audience, and engage with fellow learners, data enthusiasts, and researchers. In addition, I want to share some of my solutions to challenging probability and statistics problems, as well as practical implementations of frontier machine learning and deep learning techniques. I also plan to provide some solutions to Leetcode challenges, as well as offering tutorials on how to implement various algorithms and techniques.

I hope that my website will be a valuable resource for anyone who is passionate about data, statistics, and machine learning. Thank you for visiting, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments! You can contact me at my email address [xinwei.z@nyu.edu](mailto:xinwei.z@nyu.edu).
