Greetings,

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Biostatistics Department at the [School of Global Public Health, New York University](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/). My research focuses on statistical learning, particularly multi-class classification and support-vector machines. I also have expertise in generative models, such as energy-based and diffusion models.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Rutgers University, where I had the privilege of conducting my research under the guidance of Professor [Zhiqiang Tan](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/ztan/index.html). Preceding this accomplishment, I was awarded an A.M. in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to that, I received an A.M. in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis. My undergraduate education includes a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and a B.E. in Computer Science, both from Renmin University of China.

Through this website, I aim to share my research, projects, and insights with a broader audience, engaging with fellow learners, data enthusiasts, and researchers. I will also provide solutions to challenging probability and statistics problems, as well as practical implementations of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. Additionally, I plan to offer solutions to Leetcode challenges and tutorials on implementing various algorithms and techniques.

I hope that my website will be a valuable resource for anyone who is passionate about data, statistics, and machine learning. Thank you for visiting, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments! You can contact me at my email address [xinwei.z@nyu.edu](mailto:xinwei.z@nyu.edu).
