Hi there, and welcome to my website. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Rutgers University. Prior to that, I earned an A.M. in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). My passion for mathematics and computer science began during my undergraduate years at Renmin University of China (RUC), where I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, as well as a B.E. in Computer Science.

Through this platform, I aim to share my research and projects with a wider audience, and engage with fellow learners, data enthusiasts, and researchers. In addition, I want to share some of my solutions to challenging probability and statistics problems, as well as practical implementations of frontier machine learning and deep learning techniques. I also plan to do this is by providing solutions to Leetcode challenges, as well as offering tutorials on how to implement various algorithms and techniques. 

I hope that my website will be a valuable resource for anyone who is passionate about data, statistics, and machine learning. Thank you for visiting, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments!
